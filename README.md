# Vulnscribe
NOTE: This is in development right now. I will update the readme when this is ready for your templates and testing.

A next-generation penetration testing report generator with a built-in vulnerability database for streamlined workflows.

Overview:

VulnScribe makes the penetration testing reporting process easier, combining professional-grade customization with a powerful built-in vulnerability database. Tailored for security professionals, VulnScribe simplifies report creation, ensures accuracy, and provides actionable insights to clients and stakeholders. There are many report tools out there, but honestly the amount of effort required to get them up and running and producing good reports is significant. I think there is room for a tool that will make reporting easier, while allowing testers to build on their repeatable vulnerability database.

Key Features:

* 🌐 Multi-Format Export: Export reports as .docx or .pdf for client-ready deliverables.
* 💡 User-Friendly Workflow: Intuitive interface for a streamlined reporting experience, from findings selection to final output.

How the Vulnerability Database Works:

* Preloaded with common vulnerabilities across web applications, networks, and systems.
* Allows testers to quickly select relevant findings during the reporting process, saving time and ensuring consistency.
